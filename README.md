Cxbx-Reloaded is an emulator for running Microsoft Xbox (and eventually, Chihiro) games on Microsoft Windows.

The project began its life as a fork of Cxbx, with added 64-bit support. Work is currently underway to backport some of the improvements made from Dxbx.

Cxbx-Reloaded is early in development, however it is progressing almost daily: We now boot more titles than ever before, with more and more reaching gameplay.

## System Requirements
### Minimum
  * OS: Windows 7 64-bit or newer. 32-bit installations are not supported.
  * Video card: anything that supports Direct3D 9 (HLE) and OpenGL 3.3 (LLE).
### Prerequisites
  * Visual C++ 2015 and 2017 redistributables may be required. Download them [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).
  
## Automated Builds
Cxbx-Reloaded is not yet ready for general release, but the latest development builds can always be downloaded from our [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/SoullessSentinel/cxbx-reloaded/branch/master) service:

* [Latest build (Release-mode)](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/SoullessSentinel/cxbx-reloaded/artifacts/export/Release.zip?branch=master&job=Configuration:%20Release&pr=false)
* [Latest build (Debug-mode)](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/SoullessSentinel/cxbx-reloaded/artifacts/export/Debug.zip?branch=master&job=Configuration:%20Debug&pr=false)
* [Full build history](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/SoullessSentinel/cxbx-reloaded/history)

## Compatibility
Cxbx-Reloaded has a separate [compatibility list](https://github.com/Cxbx-Reloaded/game-compatibility/issues). If you have something to report on a title, please create or update the issue for it over there. (Please, read the [Read-me file](https://github.com/Cxbx-Reloaded/game-compatibility/blob/master/README.md) first!)

## Bug Reports
Game or software specific issues can be reported in the [compatibility list](https://github.com/Cxbx-Reloaded/game-compatibility/issues).

For emulation issues that are suspected to be generic (NOT specific to any single piece of software), a bug report can be submitted at [the Cxbx-Reloaded issue tracker](https://github.com/Cxbx-Reloaded/Cxbx-Reloaded/issues).

Make sure bug reports contains the build tested with, error message displayed (if any), screenshots, an Xbe dump (created via [Edit -> Dump Xbe Info To -> File]), and a Kernel Debug file (created when running a game when [View -> Debug Output (Kernel) -> File] is selected).

## Additional information
Cxbx-Reloaded has a [wiki](http://github.com/Cxbx-Reloaded/Cxbx-Reloaded/wiki) containing various subjects and background information.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions, large and small. If you want to do some coding, be sure to read the [Developer notes](https://github.com/Cxbx-Reloaded/Cxbx-Reloaded/wiki/Developer-notes). Please contact us before you start working on something, so we can make sure your work is going to be accepted once finished.

### Prerequisites 
1. [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/)
2. [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) (2015 should work, but is not officially supported)
3. Windows 8.1 SDK (Should be included with Visual Studio)
4. [Microsoft Child Process Debugging Power Tool](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GreggMiskelly.MicrosoftChildProcessDebuggingPowerTool)

### Fetching the code
Run the following command on the command line.
`git clone --recursive https://github.com/Cxbx-Reloaded/Cxbx-Reloaded/`

Please note that `--recursive` parameter: This is required to fetch sub-modules Without this, Cxbx-Reloaded will fail to build.
If Cxbx-Reloaded was previously checked out without the submodules, they can be updated/fetched with the following command
`git submodule update --recursive`

### Compiling
Simply open `build/Win32/Cxbx.sln` within Visual Studio, select your configuration (Release or Debug) and hit Build.
Please note that Debug builds are significantly slower, but do include much more detailed kernel logging, so these may help diagnose a problematic title.

## Special Thanks
All contributors to the original Cxbx and Dxbx projects, without which Cxbx-Reloaded would not exist at all.
