Cxbx-Reloaded is an emulator for running Microsoft Xbox (and eventually, Chihiro) games on Microsoft Windows.

The project began life as a fork of Cxbx with added 64-bit support. Work is currently underway to backport some of the improvements from Dxbx.

Cxbx-Reloaded is still pretty unstable, don't expect it to run much at this point.

## System Requirements
  * Windows 10 64-bit (May work on other versions, but this has not been tested. 32-Bit Windows is NOT supported).
  * A graphics card that supports Direct3D 8.

## Bug Reports
Cxbx-Reloaded is in the early stages right now and most games will either crash or do nothing, please do not submit issues for these games. 

I want to know what games actually do something, so if a game displays graphics before crashing, please submit a bug reports containing the error message displayed (if any), screenshots and an Xbe dump (This can be created via [Edit -> Dump Xbe Info To -> File]).

## Special Thanks
All contributers to the original Cxbx and Dxbx projects, without which Cxbx-Reloaded would not exist at all
