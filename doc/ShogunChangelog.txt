Cxbx Changelog for Shogun3D Branch

??/??/09
- Added most of my previous changes to the disten branch so I can continue
  to build my work on it (mainly because my old branch was just too slow).

- Got Smashing Drive to run at full speed.  The intro animations will now
  show as well.  Still have some buggy textures though.

- Added the changes necesarry to run XDK 4831 games.

- Added more XDK functions (I don't remember what they all were):
	IDirectSound8_EnableHeadphones (4627, 4721)
	IDirect3DDevice8_SetPixelShader (4721)
	IDirectSoundStream_Pause (4627, 4928)
	EmuXapiApplyKernelPatches (4831)

- Lots more stuff too, I just don't remember what I did exactly.  I'll log
  it when I remember :)

4/20?/09
- Unreal Championship finally shows the first intro video!  I've been at
  this game for ages, but couldn't get it to work in XP, only vista and I 
  have no screens because videos won't render in Vista for some reason
  (not even in Turok!) -_-  Anyway, I had to do a brute force hack for it
  to work (I skipped the call to IDirectSoundStream_SetHeadroom) when running
  with OllyDbg.  I couldn't get a working OOVPA for it for some odd reason!

8/29/09
- Fixed a bug in EmuDirectSoundCreateStream.  This function is sometimes called before
  DirectSoundCreate is called, so when that happens we need to initialize DirectSound
  before we can continue.

- Taz: Wanted (XDK 4432) plays intro videos and shows loading screen!
- The games listed above use the same engine and have the same bug.  If/when I find it,
  I guess both games should be okay.

10/14/09

- Added a bit of code to print out more details about the Direct3D device
  each Xbox game is trying to create.
- Added a hack to disable Tripple Buffering.  JSRF needs this for cards that
  don't support it with the parameters it's using.

	IDirect3DDevice8_GetTile (4134 - 4361)
	IDirect3DDevice8_SetTile (4134 - 4361)
	IDirect3DDevice8_IsBusy (4134 - 4361)

- Fix a bug in D3D8 4134.  IDirect3DDevice8_SetRenderState_Fillmode_1_0_3925 was giving
  us a false positive.  The problem exists in 4034 as well because whoever started
  trying to add 4034 and 4134 support just threw in a bunch of signatures from D3D8 3925
  must have been looking for similarities in that XDK.  Good idea when you don't have
  a certain XDK, but it's not 100% safe to do (or leave in unattended).
- Attempting to impliment IDirect3DDevice8_SetSwapCallback.  Some of the steps necessary
  will revolve around IDirect3DDevice8_SetVerticalBlankCallback's inner workings.  Adding 
  the callback function to execute each time D3DDevice_Present/Swap is called is easy, but
  Some of the parameters require a bit of leg work.  Right now, some of my implementation
  is guess work.  Hopefully Caustik will have a good idea of what to do.
- Even worse, the signatures for D3DDevice_SetSwapCallback and D3DDevice_SetVerticalBlankCallback
  are almost completely identical and are different by an extremely small margin.  For 4134,
  it looks the same as 4361's.  I might be over reacting, but I just don't want to screw this
  up because working on JSRF is proving to be a delicate operation!

11/26/09
- Added the following function(s)
	XnInit (5233)
	bind (5233)
	ioctlsocket (5233)
	WSAStartup (5233)
	XNetStartup (5233 - 5344)
	CDirectSoundStream_SetMode (3936)

12/1/09
- Added the following function(s)
	XACT::CEngine::RegisterNotification (4627)
	IXACTEngine_RegisterNotification (4627)
	XACT::CEngine::GetNotification (4627)
	IXACTEngine_GetNotification (4627)
	XACT::CEngine::CreateSoundBank (4928)
	IXACTEngine::CreateSoundBank (4928)
	XACT::CEngine::RegisterWaveBank (4928)
	IXACTEngine::RegisterWaveBank (4928)
	XAudioDownloadEffectsImage (4627 - 4928)

12/2/09
- Added the following function(s)
	XACT::CEngine::UnRegisterWaveBank (4928)(*)
	IXACTEngine_UnRegisterWaveBank (4928)(*)
	IDirect3DDevice8_PersistDisplay (4627 & 4928)
	XNetGetEthernetLinkStatus (4627 - 4928, 5233 & 5344)
	XGWriteSurfaceOrTextureToXPR (4627 - 4928)
- Other things
	Added D3DTOP_BLENDCURRENTALPHA (13)

- Unreal Championship gets passed the loading screen and the menus appear to be interactive
  as well.  It took F-O-R-E-V-E-R, but I'm finally beginning to make some significant progress
  since my last updates for this game.

(*) Could be wrong.  Look into IXACTEngine_SetNotification as well...

12/3/09
- Added the following function(s)
	XLaunchNewImageA (4627 & 4928)
        XGetLaunchInfo (4627 - 4928)
- Unreal Championship appears to be "almost" ingame.  The LaunchData parameter from XLaunchNewImageA
  is saved in a .bin file (CxbxLaunchData.bin) and is loaded once XGetLaunchInfo is called.  After it
  is loaded, the file is deleted so that Unreal Championship is started normally.  When CxbxLaunchData.bin
  is loaded by XGetLaunchInfo, Unreal Championship will use this data to load the desired level and
  data that goes with it.  The biggest problem is that the controller is no longer recognized after
  Cxbx is restarted.  It may take yet another hack to get around this.  If we can, we'll find out whether
  this game can be played or not.

12/26/09
- Added the following function(s)
	XSetProcessQuantumLength (4627 & 4721)
	XGetFileCacheSize (5233 & 5344)
	IDirect3DDevice8_Unknown1 (5233) (*)
	IDirect3DDevice8_SetRenderState_TwoSidedLighting (5120 & 5233)
	IDirect3DDevice8_SetRenderState_FrontFace (4531 - 5233)
	IDirect3DDevice8_SetRenderState_LogicOp (4721 - 5344)
	IDirect3DDevice8_BeginPush (5233 & 5344)
	IDirect3DDevice8_EndPush (5233 & 5344)

(*) This is not the actual function name.  Since I was unable to find any functions even somewhat similar
to it (I don't have 5233, but not even 5344 helped this time), I just created a dummy function to the game 
from crashing.  There were 4 functions that had access to it, and I had no idea which one was calling it,
nor could I find out what those functions were either.  The only lead I had was that it called the kernel
function AvSendTVEncoderOption, which led me to the assumption that we can get away with ignoring this function
for now.  So far, this only occurs in games known as "Run Like Hell" and "Oddworld Munch's Oddyssee".

12/27/09
- Added the following function(s)
	IDirect3DDevice8_AddRef (3925) [3911]
	CDirectSoundStream_GetInfo (All) (*)
	IDirect3DDevice8_Unknown1 (3925) (**)
	IDirect3DDevice8_GetViewport (3925)
	IDirect3DDevice8_GetGammaRamp (3925)
	SignalObjectAndWait (3911 - 4627)
	PulseEvent (3911)
	IDirect3DDevice8_GetDisplayFieldStatus (3925)

- Stopped Cxbx from trying to assemble "empty" shaders in Azurik: Rize of Perathia.

(*) Since this function is part of the DirectSoundStream VTable (CDirectSoundStream::vtbl), the XDK doesn't
matter.
(**) See update for 12/26/09

12/28/09
- Added the following function(s)
	IDirect3DDevice8_SetSwapCallback (4928)

	KeBugCheck (*)

- Fixed up EmuIDirect3DDevice8_UpdateOverlay a bit.  Updating the overlay
  in software lets me see video playback again and let's me take screen
  shots because it's a YUV -> RGB conversion.  Videos also play at more
  "correct" speeds in software anyway.  Unreal Championship requires
  this to be done in software to avoid crashing.  Also, since the YUV 
  overlay is done in software, it's not updated automatically like a hard-
  ware accelerated overlay, so I added a hack to update the screen if
  Present or Swap was not called since the last update of the overlay.
  this fixes most problems I've had with video playback.

	CDirectSoundStream::SetHeadroom (5558)(**)
	CDirectSoundBuffer::GetCurrentPosition (5558)
	IDirectSoundBuffer_GetCurrentPosition (5558)
	CDirectSoundStream::SetFormat (5558)
	CDirectSoundStream::SetMixBins (5558)
	D3DDevice_SetRenderTarget (5558)

	D3DDevice_FlushVertexCache (5455, 5558)
	D3DDevice_SetRenderState_LogicOp (5455, 5558)

- Added the following file(s)
	XG.1.0.4034.cpp/h

- Fixed the 5558 signature for D3DDevice_SetVertexShaderConstant1

- Added cube texture support in EmuIDirect3DDevice8_CreateTexture2

- Metal Arms (XDK 5558) is starting to work!

(*) These functions are not to be emulated, just used to find functions
that call them... making my life easer!

(**) I only added the signature, not the actual function that goes with
it.  I'll do that later because I'm just adding the stuff that Metal Arms
needs to work for now.

11/9/10
- Added the following function(s)
	D3DDevice_LightEnable (5455)
	D3DDevice_SetModelView (5455, 5558)
	D3DDevice_SetIndices (5455)
	IDirectSound_AddRef (5233)
	D3DDevice_SetVertexData4ub (4531-5344)
	D3DDevice_SetVertexData2f (5233, 5344)
	D3DDevice_SetVertexData4f (5233, 5344)
	D3DDevice_SetViewport (5344)
	D3DDevice_SetTransform (5344)
	D3DDevice_GetBackBuffer2B (5558)(*)
	D3DDevice_PersistDisplay (5558)

- An implementation of D3DDevice_SetModelView is still needed!

- Fixed a bug in HLEIntercept.cpp; XapiInitProcess sig for XDK 5344 was not
being referenced (was using 5233's sig instead).

- Tetris Worlds (5233) shows intro screens and XIII (5558) shows dirty disc
error (because I didn't hava a full dump).

(*) Nothing special, but the signature is just different by one byte
in XIII, so I created two different sigs so Metal Arms doesn't break!

11/11/10
- Added the following function(s)
	D3DDevice_Release (4361)
	D3D::CreateStandAloneSurface (4034)(*)
	D3DDevice_GetBackBuffer (4034)
	D3D::SetTileNoWait (5849)
	D3DDevice_SetGammaRamp (5849)
	CDirectSoundVoiceSettings::SetMixBins (5849)
	CDirectSoundVoice::SetMixBins (5849)
	CDirectSoundBuffer::SetMixBins (5849)
	IDirectSoundBuffer_SetMixBins (5849)
	CDirectSoundStream_SetMixBins (5849)

	IDirectSound_SetMixBinVolumes (5849)
	XnInit (5849)
	XNetStartup (5849)
	WSAStartup (5849)
	XNetGetEthernetLinkStatus (5849)
	XInputSetState (5849)
	CDirectSound::SetPosition (5849)
	IDirectSound_SetPosition (5849)

(*) D3DDevice_CreateImageSurface is just a simple call to this function.
It's the same, so treat it as such.  Add it whenever possible because
Cxbx won't crash when it's not intercepted!  I added this and Simpsons 
RoadRage started to work!

11/13/10
- Added the following function(s)
	CDirectSound::setVelocity (5849)	
	IDirectSound_SetVelocity (5849)
	CDirectSound::CommitDeferredSettings (5849)
	D3DDevice_GetRenderTarget2 (5849)

12/13/10
- Added the following function(s)
	D3D::BlockOnTime (3911) [3925]
	D3D::BlockOnResource (3911) [3925]

- Fixed a bug in NtAllocateVirtualMemory.  The Xbox exclusive flag MEM_NOZERO
holds the same value as MEM_ROTATE, causing an error to be returned (0xC00000F3)
that occurs in XP, but not Vista.

- Azurik now goes ingame on XP (due to the above fix)!  Man, I love this game so
much... *tear*

12/26/10
- Added the following function(s)
	D3DDevice_CreateCubeTexture (4361)
	D3DCubeTexture_GetCubeMapSurface (4361)

1/13/11
- Added the following function(s)

	CDirectSoundBuffer::SetRollOffCurve (4627-4928)
	CDirectSoundStream::SetRollOffCurve (4627-4928)
	IDirectSoundBuffer_SetRollOffCurve (4627-4928)
	D3D::BlockOnTime (4627-4928)
	D3DDevice_BlockOnFence (4627-4928)

1/28/11
- Added the following texture format(s)
	D3DFMT_LIN_A8

- Added the following function(s)
	D3D::PixelJar::Lock3DSurface (4627-4831)(*)
	D3D::PixelJar::Lock2DSurface (4242-5120)(*)
	D3DDevice_CreateImageSurface (4627-4831)
	D3DCubeTexture8_GetCubeMapSurface2 (4627-4831)
	XFileCreateMediaObjectEx (4627-4831)

- Fixed a bug in EmuIDirect3DDevice8_SetTextureStageState_TextureCoordIndex

- Whacked goes ingame, only on Debug mode so far.  Retail crashes.  Single
  player campaign crashes also  :(

- Quantum Redshift reaches menus.  Missing blending required option.

(*) These should have been added a long time ago.  With all due respect, I 
find it a bit amusing that D3DDevice_CopyRects was implemented and 
D3DDevice_CreateImageSurface wasn't O_o

TODO: Verify that Lock3DSurface is the same on other XDKs like Lock2DSurface

1/29/11
- Added the following function(s):
	XWaveFileCreateMediaObject (4627-4831)
	CDirectSoundBuffer::SetEG (4627-4721)
	IDirectSoundBuffer_SetEG (4627-4721)
	D3DDevice_SetSoftDisplayFilter (4627-4928)
	XGetFileCacheSize (4627-4928)
	CDirectSoundStream_SetHeadRoom (4627-4928)
	D3DDevice_SetPixelShader (4627-4928)
	D3DDevice_CreatePalette2 (4627)
	D3DPalette_Lock2 (4627)

- Added a dirty hack for a missing blend state D3DBLEND_CONSTANTCOLOR
  This is not supported by standard Direct3D, but is supported on OpenGL.

- Quantum Redshift; controller input not yet working, but updated to ingame
  status because ingame graphics do work when demos are played and loads 
  levels without problems, but complete loading fails due to a failed texture
  creation attempt (512x512xDXT1 8 mip levels).  Controller won't respond.

2/3/11
- Added the following function(s)
	XMountMUA (5558)
	Probably more I forgot.

	D3DDevice_BeginPushBuffer (4627)
	D3DDevice_EndPushBuffer (4627)

3/27/11
- Instead of redirecting DSOUND 4134 -> 4627, Write a totally new DSOUND .inl
  file for it.  See?  I'm working on JSRF...

6/25/11
- Added the following function(s)
	XInputGetDeviceDescription (4831)

- Fixed the signature for XInputCapabilities (4831). This signature is

- Xbox Dashboard (3944) is working.  Not fully functional but working.

11/3/11
- Made a few quick fixes to make the Dashboard a little more functional
  and a little less buggy/crashy. Now only the system info option will
  kill you!
