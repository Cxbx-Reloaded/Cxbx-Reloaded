: Import/Export
  * Pull upx into Import folder
  * Export Cxbx.exe/Cxbx.dll
  * Pull ntdll into Import folder
  * Pull jpegdec into Import folder
: Structure
  * Move all includes into Source (since they are not exported!)
  - Organize all #include's cleanly, and use good relative paths when desirable
  - Move things out of CxbxKrnl.h if they are internal to CxbxKrnl
- CxbxKrnl
  - CxbxKrnlVerifyVersion etc
: General Cleanup
  - AutoSwapFS (like AutoMutex)
